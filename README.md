# Prolo Counter 

Prolo Counter is a very simple counter application, developed for WatchOS using SwiftUI.

<hr/>

## Some features

- Increment and decrement the counter with vibration feedback.

- Works offline, using a local JSON file to store data.

- Has a complication that shows the actual counter in the home screen of Apple Watch.

- Has a custom application icon.

To see more in action, take a look at the little demonstration video below.
